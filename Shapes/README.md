Create a class called Shape. This class should have the following properties: name: A String that represents the name of the shape. area(): A method that calculates the area of the shape. 
Create three subclasses of the Shape class: Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle. 
The Circle class should have a radius property, the Rectangle class should have a width and height property, and the Triangle class should have a base and height property. 
Each subclass should override the area() method to calculate the area of the specific shape. 
Create a main method that creates objects of the Circle, Rectangle, and Triangle classes and calls their respective area() methods.
